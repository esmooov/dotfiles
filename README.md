Dotfiles for my development environment. Managed with [fresh]!

chmod +x ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
sudo sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh nate-wilkins
```

## *Note*

These scripts assume you are `nate-wilkins`.

It is highly recommended you clone this repository if you're using it with [EvE.Ubuntu]
if not it's okay to replace `nate-wilkins` with `<your-ubuntu-user>` (which assumes is your github username too.)
