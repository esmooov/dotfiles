## *Notes*

These scripts assume you are `nate-wilkins`.
It is highly recommended you clone this repository or call yourself `nate-wilkins`.

These scripts also assume a GitHub repository and a GitHub username that matches your `$USER`.

These scripts also contain encrypted files that won't be relevant.
To bypass these use `install.sh --skip-encrypted`.
